Picture evolution as a tree, with each branch representing a direction in which life has evolved. The branch bearing felines, for example, has twigs sprouting off for tigers, panthers and house cats. All cats in the tree cluster tidily on that one branch. Not so for crabs. Crabs appear at least five different times on five different branches in this vast evolutionary tree. The number of times nature has adapted different organisms into crabs is so striking that scientists have given the phenomenon a name: carcinization. So the next time you're feeling crabby, maybe accept that it's just what nature intended.
