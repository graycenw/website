title: "Ignite 39: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Awoooooo"
summary: [Ignite Boulder](https://igniteboulder.com/) is a night of presentations on a whole slew of geeky topics â€“ with a twist! Each presentation has 20 slides, that automatically advance after 15 seconds. Ignite events happen all over, but Boulder hosts the largest in the world every 2 or 3 months. I was selected to give a talk about my RPG group and the delights of group catharsis, which ended with the >1000-member audience doing an extremely exhilerating group holler.
